K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used
 for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. The algorithm
 aims to minimize the variance within clusters by iteratively assigning data points to
 the nearest centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned
 to each cluster. K-means is widely used for data exploration, pattern recognition, and
 segmentation tasks, offering simplicity, scalability, and efficiency in handling large datasets.

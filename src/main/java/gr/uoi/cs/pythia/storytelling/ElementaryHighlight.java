	//CharacterType -> one or more dimension levels, i.e., the coordinates of a fact that is a highlight. E.g., month
	//MeasureType -> the column with the measure name
	//MeasureValue -> the measure value
	//HighlightType -> Correlation/Dec. Tree/ HighlightPattern / Histograms / Descriptive Stats
	//ScoreType -> a description of the type of the score, e.g., Peak Rank
	//ScoreValue -> the actual score value
